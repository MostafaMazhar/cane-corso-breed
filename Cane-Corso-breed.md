If  [you’ve decided on a Cane Corso pup](http://www.americanacanecorso.com/how-to-pick-the-right-dog-breed-for-your-family/), there are a few things you should know before proceeding with the adoption.

Every day nearly 1,000 people need emergency treatment as a direct result of a dog-related injury. The purpose of sharing this information isn’t to alarm you, but rather to make you aware of the  [best practices in dog safety.](http://www.americanacanecorso.com/the-mighty-cane-corso-gains-popularity-copy/)

There are many occurrences in life we tend to categorize as a “that would never happen to me” event. But unfortunately, accidents happen. The important thing is to teach our children how to properly approach and care for a dog in order to minimize the potential for canine violence.

**Teach them how to properly touch a new animal.**
Unintentionally, children tend to pull and yank a dog’s hair. Sometimes, not realizing what they are doing, they might pinch the dog or otherwise cause unexpected pain. This is critical. If a dog feels sudden pain or a sharp tug it may react violently. Teach your children to always be gentle and considerate when handling your dog—or any animal for that matter!

**Allow the dog to approach the child willingly.**
Dogs need to feel that they have ample room to move. They don’t like when their territory is encroached upon. Especially when it comes to encountering children, a dog needs the freedom to approach the child of their own accord. Start with teaching your child to keep their distance from a Cane Corso long enough to allow the dog to approach them first.

**Don’t introduce treats or new toys during the first interactions.**
You don’t want your dog to expect a treat or toy every time they are with your child. Never set this as a precedent—only let your child implement a treat or toy as part of a reward system for good behavior and training.

**Give your new dog adequate room to breathe…i.e. time to sniff your child.**
A dog uses their sense of smell to get to know a new person. Sniffing is their way of saying ‘hello’ and otherwise greeting an unfamiliar person that they have deemed safe. This is a great method for introducing a baby to the dog. Allow the dog to smell the baby’s blanket thoroughly before making a formal introduction.

**Never interrupt a dog that is eating or sleeping.**
Dogs don’t like to be startled. Teach your child to be cautious of any action that would cause a sudden startle, thereby making the dog feel threatened.

**Teach your child to be conscientious of loud sounds and wild movements around all dogs.**
Sudden movements or sounds can really frighten a dog. Unfortunately, children are prone to both. Explain to your kids how important it is to be mindful of their noise level and physical activity around the Cane Corso and other breeds.

**Be cautious of leaving a child and a pet unattended.**
Obviously this isn’t always practical, but a dog bite usually occurs as a result of tugged fur, being sat on, or food being snatched. The best practice is to exercise extreme caution when leaving a child with a dog.

**NEVER, EVER HIT A DOG.**  
This may seem like a given, but teaching children basic manners with a dog can go a long way. In general, children should exercise the same good manners they would use with other children: never hit, never bite, don’t yell or scream, don’t take something that isn’t yours, and  _be nice_.
